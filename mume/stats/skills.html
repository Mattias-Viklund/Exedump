<h2><a name="warrior">Warrior:</a></h2>
<hr>
<DL>
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="slash">
Slashing Weapons</a></font>
<DD>The best allround weapontype for warriors and other
medium-to-high strength characters. Gives both good ob and
pb. Good weapons are broadsword, Dunadan blade, wightblade and
engraved broadsword. Generally, warriors should prac preferred weapontype(s)
to 90+ % since it increases the offensive bonus, other
classes prac it as high as you can afford (not under 50%).
Heavy slashing weapons cleaves instead (but they still uses the
slash-skill). They generally do more damage but they have less
parry bonous. Good cleaving weapons are the mighty dwarven axe and
battle axe.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="two">
Two Handed Weapons</a></font>
<DD>This skill is tailor-made for bloodthirsty warriors. Most
damage and high ob as well. It gives you a low defense
though. Good weapons are warsword, two handed axe and two
handed sword. If you are wielding a two-handed weapon you
cannot wear a shield at the same time, but you can wear
bucklers and target shields.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="conc">
Concussion Weapons</a></font>s
<DD>Not many people use this weapontype, but it is nevertheless
quite nice. Much like slashing. Good weapons are engraved
warhammer, iron-shod mace, huge black mace (evil only) and
heavy morningstar. Concussion weapons generally do a little
more damage than slashing weapons but they have less parry
bonous. A big plus with crushing weapons are that they are
efficient vs metal. That means that players dressed
in metal-armour will get more hurt when you hit them.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="stab">
Stabbing Weapons</a></font>
<DD>This weaponskill is used when wielding spear type weapons. It
used to be a subclass of piercing weapons but after som
complaints it was remade into a seperate skill. Generally
speaking stabbingweapons is like slashers but with a little
less parry then the slashingweapons has, also there is not a
single magical stabbing weapon in the game right now.
Good stabbing weapons are the iron-shafted spear, elven
hunting spear and the barbed fang (evil aligned).We haven't
heard of a single char that has pracced this skill so we can't
have any more comments on it.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="charge">
Charge</a></font>
<DD>You can 'charge' towards your victim. Requires a mount and a
charging weapon (lance and maybe pike works). If you miss you will
end up in the nearest rose bush instead. The success is also
dependant on the terrain type, best terrain is on a road.
Quite amusing to look at, but otherwise rather useless.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="kick">
Kick</a></font>
<DD>Places a well-directed boot at your enemy where it hurts
most. It doesn't seem to hurt much, though... Don't waste
practice sessions on it.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="bash">
Bash</a></font>
<DD>A must for all warriors. Renders your enemy breathless
for two combat rounds, and lowers his defence the first
hit. Maximum knowledge is a must if you get it. Bash can also
be used to destroy doors. After som recent changes you can
disengage from a bashed opponent by bashing him with the bash
disengage command.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="rescue">
Rescue</a></font>
<DD>Useful for warriors if you wanna rescue your friends (or maybe
a fair maiden) from evil enemies. Prac it to 30-40:s or so since
you always can try another rescue...
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="parry">
Parry</a></font>
<DD>A must for all classes. Increases your parry bonus. Warriors
prac it to 90+%, other classes as high as you can afford.
</DL>

<h2><a name="thief">Thief:</a></h2>
<hr>
<DL>
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="pierce">
Piercing Weapons</a></font>
<DD>Undoubtly the best weapon skill for thieves and weaker
characters such as mages. Piercing weapons are fairly light
and often give good dam. Good weapons are black runed dagger
and double-eged eket. When you are using a piercing weapon you
can get an extra attack per combat round (depending on your <a
href="skills.html#attack">attack</a> skill).
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="sneak">
Sneak</a></font>
<DD>Enables you to enter or leave a room without people noticing you.
Note that you can never sneak when you flee from a fight.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="hide">
Hide</a></font>
<DD>You can hide in a room so pople won't notice you. You can be
sensed by people that have the '<a
href="spells.html#sense">sense life</a>' spell though.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="escape">
Escape</a></font>
<DD>If you succeed this skill you can leave a fight without having
to use flee. This is a pretty useful skill for thives, but do
not use this skill in a room with several aggro mobs.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="steal">
Steal</a></font>
<DD>The name is quite self-explaining, make you able to steal from
mob or players. Stealing from players will surely make you
unpopular and is generally not a good idea. Regarding mobs,
it's often less work to just kill them instead for their loot.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="search">
Search</a></font>
<DD>Useful for searching after hidden objects and exits. One
or two practices should be enough.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="backstab">
Backstab</a></font>
<DD>Thieves prime skill. Gives superb damage, especially on
sleeping mobs. Only <a href="skills.html#pierce">piercing weapons</a>
can be used for backstabbing. It is a MUST to prac it as high
as possible (99%), at least for thieves. Backstab damage
depends on the skill knowledge, level, weapon, strength
and ob.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="dodge">
Dodge</a></font>
<DD>A must for all classes, much like <a
href="skills.html#parry">Parry</a>. Dodge increases your dodge
bonus. Since dodge bonus is also affected by dex, this skill
should be maxed especially by high-dex characters. Practice as
high as you can afford. The good thing about dodge is that it
does not get splitted between your opponents if you are
fighting several at once.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="pick">
Pick</a></font>
<DD>Used to pick locked doors, and lock unlocked doors.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="attack">
Attack</a></font>
<DD>This is a very nice skill that all <a href="skills.html#pierce">piercers</a> should consider
practising if they have the pracs to spare. This skill gives
you a chance of having 2 attacks per combat round and at also
helps when with fleeing when your auto-wimp triggers. You will
only get this chance of a second attack if you use a piercing
weapon, with any other kind of weapon you will not get it.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="missile">
Missile</a></font>
<DD>Used with missile type weapons such as bows. Not very common and
probably not worth the pracs.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="perception">
Perception</a></font>
<DD>New skill that will help you save vs backstabs.
</DL>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ranger">Ranger:</a></h2>
<hr>
<DL>
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="climb">
Climb</a></font>
<DD>Increases your climbing skills. In some places in the mountains
you need to climb. One practise is usually enough, but not
always, especially if you want to avoid falling alot and
taking damage.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="command">
Command</a></font>
<DD>This command is used to order charmed or bought mobs around,
rumours has it that it will improve riding some too.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="ride">
Ride</a></font>
<DD>Necessary for travelling longer distances. About 50-60%
will be enough. Warriors should get hit higher since <a
href="skills.html#bash">bash</a> is dependant on riding skill too if you
are mounted.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="track">
Track</a></font>
<DD>This skill has been changed alot lately. It is in many peoples
view still a must if you are going to hunt.
This skill can also be used to find mobs (by typing where
&lt;mob name&gt;).
If you are going to use this skill for hunting you must get it
to atleast 90%. If you are just going to use it to find
mobs, get it to 75+%.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="firstaid">
First Aid</a></font>
<DD>This skill is very good to have if you are a warrior,
especially if you use absorb equipment. You can use first aid
when you, or a friend, has received a wound. These wounds can be
either light, deep, serious or critical. When you bind the
wounds up with first aid they will heal faster and you will
stop loosing hps because of them.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="swim">
Swim</a></font>
<DD>You should practise this skill if you use <a
href="spells.html#port">teleport</a>.
It is not nice to misport into water and drown just beacuse you can't
swim. Warriors and others that doesn't use <a
href="spells.html#port">teleport</a>
should spend their pracs on other things.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="leadership">
Leadership</a></font>
<DD>This is still a new skill and it seems to still be
changing. What we know about it is that it reduces the sound
of a big group, and that is makes it easier to save the <a
href="spells.html#fear">fear</a> spell if the leader of the
group has this skill pracced.
