<hr>
<DL>
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="missile">
1:  Magic Missile    (3)</a></font>
<DD>This is the weakest of all offensive spells on mume.
It does about 3-8 hps of damage.
The casting time is very short and it might be used to break
the concentration of enemy casters.
Quick advice...DON'T practise it.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="ventriloquate">
1:  Ventriloquate    (5)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is also completely useless.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="detect_magic">
2:  Detect Magic     (5)</a></font>
<DD>Another almost completely useless spell. It can be used when
when you are looking through player corpses and you just want to pick
up the good stuff.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="detectinvis">
2:  Detect Invisible (5)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is a must for all classes (Yes, warriors too) on mume.
I think that casters should practise it 2-4 times and
hitters should practice it 1-2 times.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="chill_touch">
3:  Chill Touch      (5)</a></font>
<DD>It makes a damage of about 10-15 hp's and also affects you, probably
lowering your ob (but that does not seem to work). Don't
bother wasting your practice sessions on this one.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="shield">
3:  Shield          (30)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is a must for all casters. For a caster it absorbs
almost 50% of all damage taken and it can take almost 100 hps
before it goes down. Shield is one of the few spells that you
can cast while it is still in place. When you do this you will
"refresh" it and then  it will last for another 24 ticks/100 dam.
You should practise it to atleast 50+% and BNs should practise
it even higher.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="invis">
4:  Invisibility      (5)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is also a must for all casters.It makes you
invisible for all mobs and players without the spell <a href="spells.html#detectinvis">detect
invisibility</a>.It also gives you some extra dodge bonus.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="createl">
4:  Create Light     (5)</a></font>
<DD>This spell can be used to refresh your laterns and torches.
If you feel a need to get it only practise it once or twice.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="burning">
5:  Burning Hands    (7)</a></font>
<DD>This spell has become very popular among BNs and whitie-mages.
It does about 20 hps of damage (perfect against sanced
mobs/players) and it has a very short casting-time.
It is the perfect spell to use to break the concentration of
enemy casters and it is perfect to kill off those fleeing
players that are at awful.
Like all offensive spells you should get it to 95+%.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="locateobj">
6:  Locate Object   (20)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is beeing remade right now...will have more info
on it when we know for sure how it will be.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="quake">
7:  Earthquake      (15)</a></font>
<DD>This spell does about 50 hps of damage to EVERYONE but
yourself in the room. That is pretty good but bevare,
everyone that you do damage to will try and kill you. It even
affects your groupmembers in the same room, so use it with caution.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="grasp">
7:  Shocking Grasp   (9)</a></font>
<DD>This is quite a good offensive spell.It has a shorter castingtime than
<a href="spells.html#bolt">lightning bolt</a> and it can do about 40 hps of damage.
Like I wrote before.....get all offensive spells to 95+%.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="port">
8:  Teleport        (35)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is used by almost all mages and by most clerics.
It is a great way to escape form dangerous situations,
especially if you <a href="spells.html#store">store</a> it. But be prepared to be called a
wimp if you use it too often to escape combat.
In order to use it you need to have a teleport-key and you
get that by using one of the locate spells.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="nightvis">
8:  Nightvision     (25)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is used to see mobs and players in darkness and in
dense fog. You can not see the roomname with this spell.
Nowadays this spell is a must for thieves since it is a bitch
to backstab something in the dark without it. Practise it atleast
2-3 times if you are a caster since it has a minimum mana cost
of 25.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="bolt">
9:  Lightning Bolt  (11)</a></font>
<DD>Bolt is one of the best offensive spell. It is pretty fast and
it does good damage. It has regained popularity among Orcish
Shamans since it now can be practised to 85% again. If you are
a mage or a shaman you should get this spell, <a href="spells.html#burn">burning hands</a> or
<a href="spells.html#grasp">shocking grasp</a> as your fast offensive spells.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="block">
9:  Block Door      (30)</a></font>
<DD>This spell blocks a door so it cannot be opened....great for trapping people
in places where they do not want to be.<a href="spells.html#break">Break
Door</a> can be used to break a blocked door, or it can be
<a href="spells.html#skills.html#bash">bashed</a> down. If the person
that casted the block on the door is resting nearby it will be
harder to get the door opened.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="control">
10: Control Weather (25)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is used to change the weather in your
zone. Orcish-shamans use it to freeze the ford (type cast
'control weather' temp lower) and whites use it to make the
weather suitable for <a href="spells.html#call">call lightning</a> ( type 'control weather'
clouds more). Not a must but quite nifty in those special
situation described above.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="store">
10: Store           (25)</a></font>
<DD>If you store a spell you can cast it even if you are
hit. Spells with a long castingtime (fireball for example) will
be much faster to cast. Stored fireballs is one of the magic
users best friends. Get it to 80-95%.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="spray">
11: Colour Spray    (13)</a></font>
<DD>This spell does quite alot of damage especially against orcs
and undead mobs. It's one of the best offencive spells since
it is fast and storable and since it has a low manacost.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="locatel">
11: Locate Life     (20)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is also being remade right now. The only thing we
know for sure right now is that it will be the spell that
gives you port keys to use with <a href="spells.html#port">teleport</a>,
<a href="spells.html#scry">scry</a> and <a href="spells.html#watch">watch</a>
room. But exactly what you will beable to locate is uncertain.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="call">
12: Call Lightning  (15)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is awesome. It makes tons of damage but you can only
use it outside when the weather is right (stormy for lightning).
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="enchant">
12: Enchant Weapon (100)</a></font>
<DD>This spell improves the weapon it is casted upon.
<ul>
<li>If the caster is level 12-17 it gives the weapon +5%ob,
+1 damage.</li>
<li>If the caster is level 18-19 it gives the weapon +10%ob,
+1 damage.</li>
<li>If the caster is level 20+ it gives the weapon +10%ob ,
+2 damage</li>
</ul>
(Note: levels are for a mage, if you are another class it will
be different)
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="ftp">
13: Find the Path   (21)</a></font>
<DD>This spell has it's uses for exploring and finding your way to
strange places. It used to be a good hunting-spell, but after
the changes in <a href="spells.html#locateobj">Locate Object</a> it is
not that useful. It gives the shortest route to
a given portkey (sometimes that route is through a
DT, so beware). Practise it at least medium high... it has a
fairly high mana cost and you don't wanna spend all day
ftp'ing. Max range is about 1-2 zones.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="scry">
13: Scry            (20)</a></font>
<DD>This spell's main use was for hunting and spying on the
opposite side. With it you can see the room name and what is
in it. As with <a href="spells.html#ftp">Find the Path (ftp)</a>
you'll need a portkey given by the <a href="spells.html#locatel">Locate
Life</a> spell, and since the locate spells was changed it is
not as useful as before.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="charm">
14: Charm Person     (5)</a></font>
<DD>With this spell you can get mobs to follow you and help
you. It doesn't work on some mobs (especially aggressive and
higher level ones)
and it is generally considered to be pretty useless (some BNs
love it).
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="sleep">
14: Sleep           (15)</a></font>
<DD>This spell used to be great to use together with backstab, but
since the damage on sleeping mobs/players has been changed it
will probably not be as usefull as before.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="fireball">
15: Fireball        (15)</a></font>
<DD>This is the best offensive spell on mume. It does much damage,
only costs 15 mana and it is pretty fast. If you are a mage
it is a must-have.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="identify">
15: Identify       (100)</a></font>
<DD>With this spell you can find out if an object is good or
bad. It gives the stats of the object.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="dispel_magic">
16: Dispel Magic    (35)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is used to remove magic from an object or mobile.
It is pretty useless in my opinion but some people likes it.
Lurken has talked alot about wanting to use <a href="spells.html#store">stored</a> dispels
against whitie-casters so bevare :).
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="watch">
16: Watch Room      (30)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is very good to have for spying. With it you can see exactly
what the enemy is up too and you can see who is leading and
who is <a href="spells.html#sanc">sancted</a>. It does not give your
vitcims any notifications either. You will only see what is
happening in the room you are watching if you are resting and
are in a locatable room.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="silence">
17: Silence         (15)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is quite good against players (especially BNs). But
the problem is that it is quite easily saved. It takes away
the victims ability to communicate (including casting spells),
and has a few ticks duration. Not many people
that I know of use this spell at all, but it might be underrated.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="portal">
20: Portal         (100)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is also quite useful, altough it has high mana cost. With it you can move big groups
around arda. It has a pretty limited range (shorter than <a href="spells.html#port">Teleport</a>).
</DL>
<hr>
<h2><a name="cleric">Cleric:</a></h2>
<hr>
<DL>
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="armour">
1:  Armour               (5)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is a must for all classes. It gives +10% db at low
mana cost and it lasts for 24 ticks.
Casters should get it to atleast 40-50% and hitters should
practise it to 10-20%.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="cure_light">
1:  Cure Light          (15)</a></font>
<DD>Cures 1-8 hp's worth of damage. Completely useless....
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="create_water">
2:  Create Water         (5)</a></font>
<DD>Water is quite plentiful on arda so if you know your way
around this is not really a necessary spell. But if you are a
lazy caster that don't bother to carry emergency water skins it
doesn't hurt to practise this spell atleast once.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="detect_p">
2:  Detect Poison        (5)</a></font>
<DD>Tells you if objects or players are poisioned. Completely useless....
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="create_food">
3:  Create Food          (5)</a></font>
<DD>Creates tasty little mushrooms and makes you popular in hugegroups. All casters should have this
spell to atleast 50+%. When you
are high level one mushroom will fill you up.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="cure_blindness">
4:  Cure Blindness       (5)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is useful in case you get <a href="spells.html#blind">blinded</a> and dont wanna wait
until it wears off. Note that <a href="spells.html#heal">heal</a> will also cure blindness so
it might not be necessary to practise both.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="detect_e">
4:  Detect Evil          (5)</a></font>
<DD>Tells you if a mobile (or player) is evil. Completely useless....
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="bless">
5:  Bless                (5)</a></font>
<DD>This spell gives +5% ob and extra save against spells but only lasts 6 ticks. Warriors love
it, and roleplaying clerics might find it useful for blessing
everyone in their vincinity. Not a must, but gives you that extra edge you
might need.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="cureser">
5:  Cure Serious        (15)</a></font>
<DD>Casters should only get this spell if they cannot get <a href="spells.html#heal">heal</a>. If
you get it practise it quite high. A must for Orc Shamans. This spell cures about 15
hitpoints.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="blind">
6:  Blindness            (10)</a></font>
<DD>This spell rocks, and is Troll's enemy No 1 (Oh, besides
stored fireballs then :-> )  All casters must have it and even some
warriors/thiefs practice it.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="pfe">
6:  Protection From Evil (20)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is quite nifty. It will make evil mobs less
aggresive to you, and is very good for those grouped casters that
doesn't feel the urge to buffer big hard-hitting mobs.
One note though. It doesnt work for evil-aligned playes.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="str">
7:  Strength            (20)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is quite good. When the caster is level 19 or higher
it gives a +3 strength and it last for quite some time.
Warriors with practise sessions to spare should consider getting
this spell.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="sense">
7:  Sense Life           (5)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is a must. It used to protect against Backstab, but
that part has now been taken over by the perception skill.
Sense life still makes you see when someone is hidden in the
room (that might change in the future), and it also makes you
more likely to notice when you are getting
<a href="spells.html#scry">scried</a>. You will need it for hunting
brigands and other mobs (and players) that might hide themselves.
Hitters should practise this spell once or twice and casters
should get it to 30+%.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="summon">
8:  Summon              (50)</a></font>
<DD>This spell will <a href="spells.html#trans">transfer</a> the target to your location. It does
not work cross races, ie whities cannot summon darkies and vice
versa.
Not that all equipment the mob/player carried will stay in the room he
was summoned from. The Arda Ring protects you from being
summoned by anyone.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="poison">
8:  Poison              (10)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is actually quite fun...When you poison someone
he/she will not regain hits/mps/mana for the time poison
lasts. Might be useful in prolonged sieges or boring fights...
The best thing with it is that you can posion containers and
food with it. Then when someone eats the poisoned food or
drinks form the poisoned container he will get poisoned.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="cure_c">
9:  Cure Critical       (20)</a></font>
<DD>See <a href="spells.html#cureser">Cure Serious</a>. This spell will not
give any hitpoints back but it will remove your critical
wounds. Necessary for those who doesn't get <a href="spells.html#heal">Heal</a>, since
critical wounds are devastaing to your abilities. A must for
Orc Shamans, to aid their warrior friends who tend to get
critted a lot. If you are a caster, this spell is better than
<a href="skills.html#firstaid"> "First Aid"</a>.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="rem_p">
9:  Remove Poison        (5)</a></font>
<DD>Might save your life. All casters should practise this spell
twice at least.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="bob">
10: Breath of Briskness     (25)</a></font>
<DD>Freshens your and your friends tired legs, and makes you popular in
hugegroups. Note that larger groups get less moves back. Lately some
very famous warriors have started to practise it too, and in some peoples
opinion, 'bob' is a must for today's warriors. If you
are a caster you should get this spell to 90%. You will want to use
it often and it has a high manacost. Recenty this spell has
been reduced some in affectiveness, and noone really knows how
good or bad it is.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="curse">
10: Curse               (20)</a></font>
<DD>This spell gives your target -15% ob and +1 savespell.
I've never really seen anyone use it so I guess it is
considered to be pretty useless.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="divini">
11: Divination          (25)</a></font>
<DD>This spell will tell you the align (and some more info i think) about the people you are
looking at. Not much use for it, since you will notice if your target
is hostile to you anyway. Pretty useless.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="wor">
11: Word of Recall       (5)</a></font>
<DD>This spell will transport you to certain spots of "ancient
power". Has much lower mana cost than teleport, and has short
casting time. Some clerics use it, but it requires certain
knowledge about the world of Arda. Most casters tend to get
<a href="spells.html#port">teleport</a> instead. A very convenient way
for Orc Shamans to zap back to thier caves.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="dispel_e">
12: Dispel Evil         (20)</a></font>
<DD>This spell will hurt players and mobs that are more evil than
you. It does the most damage in good zones (Rivendell is best)
and might be useful in pk situations (it is extremely usefull
inside Rivendell) but it has quite high manacost compared to the mage spells.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="rem_curse">
12: Remove Curse         (5)</a></font>
<DD>Casters might wanna practise this spell once or twice, just in
case. I have never been cursed by anything though, and it's not
lethal anyway.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="energy_drain">
13: Energy Drain        (35)</a></font>
<DD>This spell takes experience from the mobs you drain. It will
also make you more evil. In my opinion, not worth the pracs.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="sanc">
13: Sanctuary           (50)</a></font>
<DD>If you can get this spell you should. Great for buffering
large, hard-hitting mobs.It used to reduce the damage of
a hit or spell to a maximum of 18 hps. Now it has changed so
its effectiveness is dependant on wis (rumour from CH says that
the formula is 50-(wis+wil) maxdam / hit).
Practice it quite high.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="darkness">
13: Darkness            (25)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is darkie only. It makes the room you are in and some
adjacent ones dark, even in daytime. Orc Shamans should get this
spell quite high.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="heal">
14: Heal                (50)</a></font>
<DD>The Cleric's prime spell. This spell is a must for all casters that can get it. It gives
+100 hps and it will remove critical wounds (see <a
href="spells.html#cure_c">Cure Critical</a>). This spell is
also the best way to get rid of disease, but watch out. If you
have been drinking out of a waterskin when you were sick you
will contaminate that skin so when you drink out of it the
next time you will get sick again.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="trans">
14: Transfer            (50)</a></font>
<DD>This spell works almost like <a href="spells.html#summon">summon</a> (same
rules apply) but the person/mobile being
transferred keeps all his/her equipment. This spell can be
saved so if you are gonna tras someone he should have all
no-summon objects removed and be sleeping.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="fear">
15: Fear                (20)</a></font>
<DD>This spell rocks for Clerics. It can cause those that are "weak at heart"
(that is, those with low wil) to flee from the room and if you have some
luck they will have a heartattack and die instantly. Use it to split up
big concentrations of enemy players or mobs.
Observe that this spell will affect everyone in the room that
are not grouped with you. You will not get any experience
point for damage done, or kills, either (a bug?).
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="harm">
15: Harm                (25)</a></font>
<DD>This spell does pretty fair amount of damage (it has been said
to do about 120 hps worth of damage), but it is slow,
unstorable (like all clerical spells) and it has a ridiculous
high mana cost. One of few benefits with harm is that is goes
right through the shield spell. Most Orc Shamans like to use
this spell.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="black_breath">
16: Black Breath        (25)</a></font>
<DD>Darkie only and compleately useless. This spell will remove
some mana and some moves from the target. The problem is that
it costs more mana to cast than it will remove from the target.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="break">
17: Break Door          (50)</a></font>
<DD>This spell is very useful. It will destroy a door for a period
of time so it cannot be closed or locked. Very good againt
those mobs that likes to lock themselves in, and it is
extremely usefull for making sure that you aren't trapped in
bad spots. See also <a href="spells.html#block">Block Door</a>.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="hold">
17: Hold                (??)</a></font>
<DD>Darkie only. It makes your victim unable to move for a short time
while you can whack him/her to Mandos. This spell has recently
been changed and noone really knows what it does anymore.
Rumour says that is sucks.
<DT><font size=4 color=000000><a name="raise_dead">
20: Raise Dead          (80)</a></font>
<DD>Darkie only. This spell will raise a shadow from the corpse it
is casted upon. That is quite useful since the caster will
have a pretty good buffer. Some Orc Shamans are known to wander
Arda with "shadow of the Kennel master" :->.
This spell used to be good when did shadow did all the
backbuffing but after the changes to the buffing system it is
not so good. Shadows sucks too.
